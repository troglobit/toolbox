#+TITLE:  Swimlanes Example with Emacs org-mode

# This .org-file requires that you have mscgen installed

* Introduction

Help!

Don't worry, start by installing =mscgen= on your system.  Then
add some magic Lisp code to your =~/.emacs=.

If you have a =custom-set-variables= section, then simply add the
following to it:

: '(org-babel-load-languages (quote ((python . t) (mscgen . t) (dot . t))))

Then you're set to go. Check out the example at
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-mscgen.html
or
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/ob-doc-mscgen.html
to try this thing out :-)

* MSC for some fictional process

#+begin_src mscgen :file chart.png
msc {
  hscale = "2";

  a,b,c;

  a->b [ label = "ab()" ] ;
  b->c [ label = "bc(TRUE)"];
  c=>c [ label = "process(1)" ];
  c=>c [ label = "process(2)" ];
  ...;
  c=>c [ label = "process(n)" ];
  c=>c [ label = "process(END)" ];
  a<<=c [ label = "callback()"];
  ---  [ label = "If more to run", ID="*" ];
  a->a [ label = "next()"];
  a->c [ label = "ac1()\nac2()"];
  b<-c [ label = "cb(TRUE)"];
  b->b [ label = "stalled(...)"];
  a<-b [ label = "ab() = FALSE"];
}
