mcjoin for Debian
-----------------

(Jul 13th, 2014)

mcjoin is a small multicast helper tool.  It can be used to join one or
many IPv4 multicast groups on any interface.  When joining on an interface
that is not the default gateway a --repeat=N argument can be used to ensure
that mcjoin re-joins the stream(s) every N seconds.

Don't use it on the Internet.
